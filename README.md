# CT Coding Sessions

This is a collection repo with all the examples generated during coding sessions in the seminar [Creative Technologists - Tracing the City](https://fhp.incom.org/workspace/8527).

In the folder packages you will find all the session. 

## Usage

Due to the fact that we have multiple repos we use lerna to bootstrap them all.


```bash
git clone git@github.com:FH-Potsdam/ct-code-examples.git
cd ct-code-examples
npm install
npm run setup
```

Now all the subfolders should have their dependencies installed. You are good to go. Open one of the subfolders in your editor and hack away.
