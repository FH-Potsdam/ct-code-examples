# CT Coding Sessions

This is a collection repo with all the examples generated during coding sessions in the seminar [Creative Technologists - Tracing the City](https://fhp.incom.org/workspace/8527).

In the folder packages you will find all the session. Currently:

```plain
└── packages
    ├── examples // <- From the slides
    └── test-project // <- From the first session 2019-10-25
```

## Usage

Due to the fact that we have multiple repos we use lerna to bootstrap them all.


```bash
git clone REPONOME
cd REPONAME
npm install
npm run setup
```

Now all the subfolders should have their dependencies installed. You are good to go. Open one of the subfolders in your editor and hack away.
